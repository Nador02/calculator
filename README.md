This is a calculator website project that I created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It involves 4 function of whole numbers and decimals, and can do functions such as clear and delete single numbers/symbols. It is my first major web dev project, and was developed based off the project guidelines put forth by the educational program: "The Odin Project".
